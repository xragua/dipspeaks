<h4 id="orbital_phase_to_time">orbital_phase_to_time</h4>
<hr />
<pre><code>Converts orbital phase array to time array for a compact object orbiting a companion star.
The compact object moves faster at periastron than at apoastro. The increased orbital speed at periastron is primarily due to the conservation of angular momentum, which dictates that as the compact object moves closer to the central star, it must travel faster to maintain the total angular momentum of the system. This relationship is further influenced by Keplerâs laws of planetary motion, which describe how objects sweep out equal areas in equal times and the gravitational force between two bodies, which strengthens as they approach each other and weakens as they move apart.

Parameters:
- ph (array-like): Orbital phase array.
- precision (float, optional): Resolution for the phase array. Default is 0.01.
- A form will appear to input the necessary orbital parameters. These parameters will be saved in a .txt file in the current directory and automatically loaded in subsequent runs. This avoids the need to re-enter all parameters; you can modify only those that require adjustment.

Returns:
- ph (array-like): Orbital phase array (same as input).
- time (array-like): Time array corresponding to the orbital phase.

<h3 id="fitting">Fitting</h3>
<p>If we have real data from a feature (NS spin period, emission line...) affected by Doppler or absorption or stellar density affected by orbital modulations we can recover the orbital parameters with the following functions. Keep in mind that "_ps" referes to particle swarm while "_ls" to least squares fitting approaches. "_ls" might not allways converge and "_ps" might take a lot of time to complete.</p>
<h4 id="fit_orbit_ps">fit_orbit_ps</h4>
<hr />
<pre><code>fit_orbit_ps fits observed orbital modulation data by estimating parameters such as phase, semi-major axis, orbital period, eccentricity, inclination, and periapsis.

The fitting process utilizes a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which iteratively improves parameter estimates by minimizing the chi-squared difference between observed and predicted data.

The function can handle two fitting methods:

- Discrete: Suitable for discrete data points (e.g., spectra with small orbital phase ranges, faster).
- Extended: Suitable for data with varying or extended bin sizes, typical with current instrument resolutions (e.g., XMM-Newton and Chandra) and short X-ray binary (XRB) orbits.

Inputs:
- x_data: Time bins of the observed data.
- y_data: Observed data points corresponding to each time bin.
- y_err: Error associated with each observed data point (default is 0).
- num_iterations: Number of iterations for PSO optimization (default is 3).
- maxiter: Maximum number of iterations for each PSO run (default is 1000).
- swarmsize: Number of particles in the PSO swarm (default is 100).
- units: Units of the observed data (default is "keV").
- method_: Fitting method to use, either "discrete" or "extended" (default is "extended").
- extended_binsize: Bin size for extended method (default is 0.01).
- A form will appear to input the necessary bounds for the orbital parameters. These parameters will be saved in a .txt file in the current directory and automatically loaded in subsequent runs. This avoids the need to re-enter all parameters; you can modify only those that require adjustment.


Outputs:
- DataFrame of the best-fit parameters and their standard deviations.
- ph: Array of phases corresponding to the predicted data.
- predicted_data: Predicted data based on the best-fit parameters.
- r_squared: Coefficient of determination (R-squared) indicating the quality of fit.

<pre><code>fit_disc_ls fits orbital modulation data by estimating parameters such as phase, semi-major axis, orbital period, eccentricity, inclination for the main orbit, and corresponding parameters for a secondary orbit (e.g., ballistic capture of matter around a compact object or an accretion disk).

The fitting process uses a traditional least squares (LS) method, provided here for completeness despite its potential limitations due to the model's complexity.

The function can handle two fitting methods:

- Discrete: Suitable for discrete data points (e.g., spectra with small orbital phase ranges, faster).
- Extended: Suitable for data with varying or extended bin sizes, typical with current instrument resolutions (e.g., XMM-Newton and Chandra) and short X-ray binary (XRB) orbits.

Inputs:
- x_data: Time bins of the observed data.
- y_data: Observed data points corresponding to each time bin.
- y_err: Error associated with each observed data point (default is 0).
